import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getMotionEvents } from '@/lib/db'; // We might need a getMotionEventById function
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// This is where your recorded video files would be stored.
const RECORDINGS_DIR = path.join(process.cwd(), 'recordings');

  { params }: { params: { eventId: string } }
) {
  const { eventId } = params;

  if (!eventId) {
    return new NextResponse('Event ID is required', { status: 400 });
  }

  // --- Real Implementation ---
  // In a real-world scenario, you would do the following:
  // 1. Get the event details from the database to find the associated video file path.
  //    const event = await getMotionEventById(eventId);
  //    if (!event || !event.videoFilePath) {
  //        return new NextResponse('Event not found or no video associated', { status: 404 });
  //    }
  //
  // 2. Construct the full path to the video file.
  //    const videoPath = path.join(RECORDINGS_DIR, event.videoFilePath);
  //
  // 3. Check if the file exists.
  //    if (!fs.existsSync(videoPath)) {
  //        return new NextResponse('Video file not found on disk', { status: 404 });
  //    }
  //
  // 4. Stream the file to the client. For HLS, you would point to a .m3u8 playlist file.
  //    For this example, we assume you have a system to generate HLS playlists for recorded events.
  //    const playlistPath = `${videoPath}/playlist.m3u8`;
  //    const playlistContent = fs.readFileSync(playlistPath, 'utf-8');
  //
  //    return new NextResponse(playlistContent, {
  //      status: 200,
  //      headers: {
  //          'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.apple.mpegurl',
  //          'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  //      },
  //    });


  // --- Simulation for Demonstration ---
  // Since we don't have a recording engine, we will simulate this by using
  // the LIVE stream of the camera associated with the event as a placeholder.
  // This demonstrates the frontend player and backend API route are working together.
  
  // NOTE: This is a placeholder. You'll need to add `getMotionEventById` to your db.ts
  // For now, we know our mock events are for 'cam-1' which has a known rtspUrl.
  // This is a temporary hack for demonstration.
  const mockCameraRtspUrl = 'rtsp://192.168.1.101:554/stream1';
  const streamId = btoa(mockCameraRtspUrl);
  const liveStreamUrl = `/api/stream/${streamId}`;
  
  // We can't directly serve the stream from here.
  // We need to redirect the HLS player to the live stream API route.
  // A proper implementation would serve the recorded file directly as shown above.
  // The HLS.js player will handle the redirect.
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(liveStreamUrl, request.url));
